Past lives
Borns

Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feeling
This isn't our first time around
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Some time the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
All my past lives
They've got nothing on me
Golden eagle, you're the one and only flying high
Through the cities in the sky
I'll take you way back
Countless centuries
Don't you remember?
That you were meant to be my Queen of Hearts
Meant to be my love
Through all of my lives
I never thought I'd wait so long for you
The timing is right
The stars are aligned
So save that heart for me
Cause girl you know that you're my destiny
Swear to the moon, the stars
The sons, and the daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
Hey, I need you now
I've waited oh so long yeah
Baby love, I need you now
I've waited oh so long
Passing seasons
Empty bottles of wine
My ancient kingdom came crashing down without you
Baby child, I'm lost without your love
Diamond sparrow, my moonlight majesty
You know I need you, come flying back to me
Through all of my lives
I never thought I'd wait so long for you
The timing is right
The stars are aligned
So save that heart for me
Cause girl you know that you're my destiny
Swear to the moon, the stars
The sons, and the daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
Save that heart for me
And girl I'll give you everything you need
Here's to our past lives
Our mothers and fathers
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
Hey I need you now
I've waited oh so long yeah
Baby love, I need you now
I've waited oh so long
Hey I need you now
I've waited oh so long yeah
Baby love, I need you now
I've waited oh so long
So save that heart for me
Cause girl you know that you're my destiny
Swear to the moon, the stars
The sons, and the daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
Save that heart for me
And girl I'll give you everything you need
Here's to our past lives
Our mothers and fathers
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
Hey I need you now
I've waited oh so long
